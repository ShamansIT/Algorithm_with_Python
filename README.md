Description.
1. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is a string searching method that seeks the occurrence of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to dictate where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.

2. Boyer-Moore-Horspool Algorithm
An optimization of the Boyer-Moore algorithm, the Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm is renowned for its efficiency in practical string search scenarios. It simplifies the original algorithm by using a bad-character shift of the rightmost character of the window to improve average-case time complexity, particularly for long search strings.

3. Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is a fundamental approach for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It is known for its efficiency and accuracy in calculating the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph, with weights representing distances, costs, or any metric that signifies an obstacle to traversal.

4. Floyd's Algorithm
Also known as Floyd-Warshall, Floyd's algorithm is a dynamic programming solution for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). It efficiently calculates the minimum distances between all pairs of vertices, making it ideal for dense graphs.

5. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy approach for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. It identifies paths with available capacity and adds this capacity to the total flow iteratively, effectively solving network flow problems such as circulation, maximum matching, and others.

6. Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph.

7. Prim's (Nearest Neighbor) Algorithm
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted undirected graph. It starts with a single vertex and then adds the nearest neighbor to the growing tree until it spans all the vertices.

8. Sorting by Selection
Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

9. Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

10. Bubble Sort (Pop-up Bubble Method)
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

11. Merging Two Ordered Lists
This algorithm involves taking two pre-sorted lists and merging them into a single, sorted, cohesive list. It is a fundamental process in the merge sort algorithm, ensuring that the resulting merged list maintains the order of the elements from the input lists.

12. Quick Merge Sort
Quick merge sort is likely a variant combining elements of quicksort and merge sort, two of the most efficient sorting algorithms. Both algorithms use divide-and-conquer strategies to sort arrays or lists efficiently, with quicksort partitioning the list around a pivot element and merge sort dividing the list into the smallest unit and merging them in a sorted manner.

13. Quick Hoare Sort
Quick Hoare sort refers to the original version of quicksort developed by Tony Hoare. It is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer principle. It selects a pivot and partitions the array into two, sorting each part recursively.

14. LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) Stack
A stack is a collection of elements that follows the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. This structure is widely used in computer science for various algorithms and processes, such as function call management in programming languages.
